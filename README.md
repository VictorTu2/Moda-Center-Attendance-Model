# Moda Center Attendance Model
 
For my Math Modeling class we were tasked with using a mathematical tool to model a real-life situation. My group decided to model the fan attendance rate of the Moda Center. We initially used SIR models to create our models and equations, then created a for loop through Python to measure three different hypotheticals.
